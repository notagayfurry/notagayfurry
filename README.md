# 👋 Yo! I'm [Matthew](https://github.com/notagayfurry) 🎉
I am 15 years old.

Welcome to my GitHub cave! Here, I mess around with tech stuff, like writing code that never works. Here’s some pointless info about me (you’re probably not gonna read it all, but whatever):

## 🚀 Stuff I do... maybe
- **I write code** (sometimes it even works): things like Python,and other languages I barely understand myself.
- **Cloud and other nerdy stuff:** yeah, I love making VMs on DigitalOcean and Linode. I host useless stuff on there.
- **Open Source?!:** Mostly just watch other people do the real work.

## 🖥️ Other tech thingz
- **Languages:** Python (🐍 no, not the snake. terrible joke, dont cancel me pls), HTML (for making sites no one visits), CSS (for trying to make them pretty, but failing).
- **Complicated things:** long a** message.
- **Toolz:** long a** message.
- **Cloud stuff:** AWS, Linode, Cloudflare, and Vercel.

## 😾 Furry 
Yep, I’m a furry. Don’t ask why, I just am. 😾🎨
